This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

In the ever-evolving world of web development, the line between various frameworks and libraries can sometimes blur, leading to misconceptions and controversies. One such controversy recently stirred up on the official Next.js subreddit when a small snippet from an email was taken out of context, claiming that "Next.js is React." As it turns out, this statement is far from accurate, and in this comprehensive blog post, we aim to unravel the truth behind Next.js and React, shedding light on their differences, unique features, and why Next.js stands as the future of web development.

At first glance, it's easy to see why some might think that Next.js and React are synonymous. React serves as the foundation upon which Next.js is built, much like JavaScript serves as the foundation for React itself. However, just as React extends JavaScript with its own set of features, Next.js adds additional capabilities to React, transforming it into a full-stack framework. This distinction is crucial in dispelling the notion that Next.js is simply React.

To solidify this argument, let's turn to the official documentation of both React and Next.js. React, in its current form, is not designed for server-side rendering (SSR). While it's true that React's server components are in development, they are far from being recommended for production use. The React team advises using existing frameworks until server components are more stable. On the other hand, Next.js excels in SSR, making it a reliable choice for server-side rendering. This difference in SSR capabilities is a clear indicator that Next.js is not just React with a different name.

Let's back this up with an excerpt from Next.js's documentation. It's stated that "Next.js can handle SSR right now at this moment reliably as a full-stack framework." This reliability in handling server-side rendering sets Next.js apart from React and highlights its unique capabilities.

React has been a game-changer in the web development world, thanks to features like the virtual DOM and improved development workflows. However, Next.js takes the benefits of React to a whole new level. Next.js can be thought of as React on steroidsâ€”it not only kicks up performance several notches but also accelerates development. This difference in performance and development speed emphasizes that Next.js isn't just React; it's React empowered.

## [Permalink](https://taquideveloper.hashnode.dev/nextjs-isnt-react#heading-server-side-vs-client-side-rendering "Permalink")Server-side vs. Client-side Rendering

The core distinction between Next.js and React lies in their approach to rendering. React primarily relies on client-side rendering, where the browser executes JavaScript to display the page. In contrast, Next.js employs server-side rendering, where the server pre-renders the content before sending it to the client. This pre-rendering reduces the amount of JavaScript that needs to be executed on the user's browser, resulting in faster page loading times.

The decision of when to use server-side rendering versus client-side rendering is crucial in understanding Next.js's unique approach. To simplify this decision, Next.js provides a helpful chart to guide developers. If your code involves fetching data, backend operations, or can work on the server, it's better suited for server-side rendering. Client-side rendering is reserved for code that relies on browser-specific interactions, such as buttons, input fields, and other client-side functionality.

Beyond performance gains, Next.js offers significant advantages in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and user experience. SEO is vital for websites to be discoverable on search engines like Google. Traditional client-side rendering, which sends minimal HTML content along with heavy JavaScript files, can hinder SEO as search engine crawlers struggle to interpret JavaScript. In contrast, Next.js's server rendering approach sends complete HTML files to crawlers, resulting in better SEO.

Moreover, faster initial page load times are not only essential for SEO but also for providing users with an excellent experience. Users today expect websites to load quickly. With Next.js, the burden of executing JavaScript on the user's device is reduced, resulting in faster page loads and a better overall user experience.

## [Permalink](https://taquideveloper.hashnode.dev/nextjs-isnt-react#heading-resource-proximity-and-security "Permalink")Resource Proximity and Security

One intriguing benefit of Next.js's server-side rendering approach is resource proximity. This concept encompasses reduced network latency, improved data locality, and enhanced security. Reduced network latency means that information travels more quickly between the server and the client, leading to faster data retrieval. This is especially important for online gaming, where low latency (often referred to as "ping") is critical.

In terms of data locality, Next.js ensures that server-side resources and databases are physically located near the server. This proximity enhances data access speed, benefiting both performance and user experience. Additionally, Next.js enhances security by allowing sensitive data and API keys to be kept server-side, preventing them from being exposed on the client side.

While server-side rendering is a significant aspect of Next.js, it offers much more. Next.js boasts features like file-based routing, improved loading, and error state management, making it a comprehensive framework for modern web development. It's no wonder that Next.js is not only recommended but increasingly becoming the preferred choice in the React community.

As an author deeply entrenched in the world of Next.js, I can confidently assert that Next.js is not just React with a new name. I've personally used Next.js for every personal and commercial project since Next.js 1.3, and I've witnessed its evolution firsthand. My team and I have dedicated ourselves to creating educational content, including a 100-page Next.js ebook, and we are continuously expanding it to provide the latest insights.

Furthermore, I'm excited to announce the upcoming release of the Ultimate Next.js Course, a project-based course that delves even deeper into the world of Next.js. This course goes beyond my YouTube videos, providing an interactive and in-depth understanding of web development and Next.js.

## [Permalink](https://taquideveloper.hashnode.dev/nextjs-isnt-react#heading-conclusion "Permalink")Conclusion

In conclusion, it's essential to dispel the misconception that Next.js is merely React under a different name. Next.js builds upon React's foundation, offering enhanced server-side rendering, improved SEO, and a better user experience. Its benefits extend beyond SSR, making it a robust choice for modern web development. So, as we navigate the dynamic landscape of web development in 2023, remember that Next.js is not Reactâ€”it's the future of web development. If you're ready to explore Next.js's full potential, I invite you to join the waitlist for the Ultimate Next.js Course and embark on an exciting journey into the world of Next.js.
